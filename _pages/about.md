<!-- ![Illustration of combining vision and language modalities](/images/image_to_text_vis.png){: .align-right width="300px"} -->
👨🏻‍💻 I hold a Bachelor's in Computer Sicene and I have done my Bachelor's thesis on Object Detection.

🔬 My research interests are in Machine Learning, Generative AI, Natural Language Processing and Distributed Systems!

<!-- 📚 I'm currently working towards my Master's Thesis in the field of Vision-Language-Modelling. -->

📽️ I am also interested in assisting others on their path in the world of Machine Learning and academia.

<!-- # Selected Experience

## 🤖 Open Source Contributions
I have experience contributing to [Arena Bench](https://github.com/Arena-Rosnav) a large open-source project for robotic obstacle avoidance using Deep Reinforcement Learning.

Moreover, I have published a [respective paper](https://sudo-boris.github.io/publication/2022-Arena-Bench) at the IROS conference and in the Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) journal.

## 📜 Reimplementing and Reproducing Papers
I have experience with independent research. I have implemented the Reward Constrained Policy Optimization paper into stable-baselines3 PPO and reproduced the original results by running and tracking experiments.

To accompany this work, I have submitted a blog post to the **ICLR** Blogposts Track communicating the paper's theory and my results.

Feel free to look at my specific [portfolio entry](https://sudo-boris.github.io/portfolio/RCPPO/). -->

## 👨🏻‍🔬 Professional Experience
I have served as a Teaching Assistant for the courses **"Artificial Intelligence"**, **"Advanced Programming"**, **"Introduction to programming (in Python)"** and **"Non-Linear Optimization"**. Additionally, I have been a Research Assistant working on Generalization of Object Detection models on Persian Historical Artwork.

<!-- ## 📚 Teaching and Community Contributions
To further contribute to the Machine Learning community, I have a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@borismeinardus) and [Medium](https://medium.com/@boris.meinardus) channel where I publish educational Machine Learning content.
